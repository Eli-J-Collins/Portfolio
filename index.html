          Hello, my name is Elijah Collins. I am a graduate(to-be) at Verrado High School, as well as the 
          CTE/Trade School District at West-Mec. I am looking for oppurtunies in the fields of Web Development,
          either in an entry level position, or one with more versatility available. During my time at the Western 
          Maricopa County Education Center, or West-MEC, I had recieved two seperate certifications for my skills 
          I picked up during their coding programs. And while not officially recognized; I have learned how to use 
          some Adobe Software, such as: Photoshop, Excel, Dimensions, and more during classes at Verrado High School.
          At West-MEC, as well as other entry-level occupations I've worked while enrolled in school; I've learned how 
          to work and operate in a team, appear and act professional amongst my peers, and have learned two seperate 
          languages as well as started learning a third. I want to make a difference within the field of coding by 
          revolutionizing the design process, while making fluid and easy to understand software for people to expand on. 
          Because in the realm of code, everyone helps everyone build eachother up, and that's how society should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of working and the professional life as a whole; there are plenty of things I enjoy to do with my time.
          Some people may consider me as down to earth, others as a competitor, game organizer, influencer, writer, chef, 
          or anything else. In truth; I see myself as a man who seeks to enjoy life in anyway he can. I'm an avid fan of 
          many different video games, as well as writing and reading novels. Through the help of my family; I was taught 
          how to cook.
        <br>
        <br>
          In addition to all of this; you can also find me on some online platforms; such as Twitch, Youtube, and Twitter; 
          where I post content of me playing games, making further content about or on things I feel like doing or talking 
          about.
